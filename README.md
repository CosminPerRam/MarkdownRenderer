# MarkdownRenderer
This is a project made for my "Advanced Programming Methods" university class.

It is made in Java (a requirement) and uses Swing for the UI elements.

This Markdown Renderer can also be used as a simple Notepad.

## Downsides
- Does not support the entire Markdown standard.
- Not very performant, the render processing goes through the entire input on 
every change.
